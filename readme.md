## Auto Dark Mode

Dark mode but it automatically changes based on if your os is set to dark or light mode.

Optionally, if you're a windows user, install [windows auto night mode.](https://github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode/releases/tag/3.0) (note: windows currently doesn't support automatic light to dark) if your OS supports automatic light to dark modes, ignore this.

## Work Mode

Removes all distracting assets from turntable such as avatars, vote buttons, staging, join dj buttons and video so you can get back to work and stop worrying about pressing join or watching avatars dance. The work mode addition pairs well with autowoot/autobop and auto join.
